# GreenScan – AI-Based Crop Disease Detection and Cure Assistant  
**Presented at INFOTHON 4.0**

**GreenScan** is an intelligent web-based system designed to help farmers and agricultural workers identify crop diseases early by simply uploading a leaf image. It provides accurate disease detection, relevant cure suggestions, and even chatbot support for unknown cases — all without needing expert intervention.

## What GreenScan Offers

- **Leaf Image Diagnosis** – Upload images of infected plant leaves to get disease predictions.  
- **AI-Based Detection** – Uses a deep learning model to identify 38 different crop diseases.  
- **Cure Recommendations** – Displays relevant cures and treatments stored in the database.  
- **Chatbot Support** – If the disease is unknown, describe the symptoms to get NLP-based help.  
- **Farmer Friendly** – Provides guidance in simple language, minimizing dependence on agronomists.

## Technical Workflow

GreenScan follows a well-structured AI pipeline to detect crop diseases from images and provide appropriate cure recommendations.

### How It Works

1. **Image Upload via Web Interface**  
   Users upload a plant leaf image through the Flask-based web UI.

2. **Image Preprocessing**  
   The uploaded image is resized, normalized, and converted to array format using OpenCV, Pillow, and NumPy.

3. **AI-Based Prediction**  
   The pre-trained MobileNetV2 (TensorFlow) model predicts the disease from 38 trained classes with high accuracy.

4. **Cure Retrieval from MongoDB**  
   Based on the predicted disease, the system queries MongoDB to fetch pre-stored cure details and displays them.

5. **Fallback: Chatbot for Unrecognized Symptoms**  
   If the disease isn’t confidently predicted, users can describe the symptoms in text. The integrated NLP chatbot parses the description and maps it to known diseases using a keyword-based approach, then suggests matching cures.
